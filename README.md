this code is based on the coteaching model, and we modified it for denoising data and fusing data.
we used this method in the artical [Performance optimization of BP-DNN prediction model of suction caisson uplift bearing capacity employing modified Co-teaching method] Yixiao Luan, Xiaowei Tang*, Yubin Ren
